Statement of Intent: I aim to craft a formal report to critique the negative impact that brain computer interfaces have on humans to understand whether we should allow their use.

Brain-Dead Brainwave Devices?

We are all living in a society that is connected through technology. A world where we can connect directly with all 5 senses is approaching like a bat out of hell. With all the adversity that has occurred from technology, is it wise to connect our brain? The hazards associated with brain computer interfaces (BCIs) can be unnerving. Drilling a hole into someones head is often associated with horror films over the medical benefit of an individual. Moreover, interfering directly with a brain, when our society already has many mental maladies, could be detrimental. Already, we are struggling with motivation and attention, which is likely due to our endless scrolling of social media. Maybe BCIs are more bane than boon.


Copied Paragraphs From Original

I recently read the book "Brainjack" by Brian Falkner which is set in a world where neural devices are mainstream. Within this book, it highlighted dangers that could potentially occur when the brain is connected to a device. This made me think about the current state of BCIs and whether there is a possibility that brain computer interfaces are more dangerous or more helpful. To find out more about the risks and considerations of this topic, I decided to do a research report on it. My inquiry focus is “whether brain computer interfaces have an overall positive impact on humans”. I broke this question down into three parts so that I was able to research and assess the result of my inquiry, “What are the negative effects of brain computer interfaces?”, “What are the positive effects of brain computer interfaces?” and lastly, “How can we improve the effects of brain computer interfaces?”.

What are the negative effects of brain computer interfaces?
There are many negative impacts from brain computer interfaces. The opinion paper, "Declaration on the ethics of brain–computer interfaces and augment intelligence", explores the ethical considerations of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) along with the physical and mental impacts. The paper references medical studies of BCIs and there are several potential risks that include wound infection, paraesthesia, seizures, intracerebral haemorrhage, hemiplegia, cerebral infarction, and iatrogenic harms (Zeng, Sun, & Lu, 2021). Although most of these risks have a low risk of death, some such as intracerebral haemorrhage has a 40% risk of death and a high rate of disability (Woo, et al., 2022). I understood that BCIs were likely to have risk factors, but seeing the massive medical impacts that can occur, such as disability or death, due to using them makes me hesitant to believe that the gains outweigh the risks.
BCIs do not only impact the physical state of a person.
The perspective article, "Informed consent in implantable BCI research: identification of research risks and recommendations for development of best practices" identifies risks that do not pertain only to physical health. "A small subset of individuals with DBS develop significant, and sometimes dramatic, changes in personality, such as loss of interest in work, change in expectations of sex and marriage, and Unhappiness" (Klein & Ojemann, 2016). I think that personality is the most important part of our being because we identify ourselves from our personality. I know firsthand what it is like for family where one member has had drastic personality changes and I have seen the damage it does. This leads me to believe that there is significant risk of using BCIs and the severity of personality change could outweigh all the positives. The components that make up the BCI devices are also susceptible to rapid obsolescence which reduces the useful information that can be gained for clinical trials (Klein & Ojemann, 2016). This would subject the patient to needlessly have more surgeries than would be required. I doubt having more surgeries is a good thing as it leads to more possibilities of infections. Based on this evidence I find that BCIs are in a state where there is not enough benefit gained.
"Brain–Computer Interface-Controlled Exoskeletons in Clinical Neurorehabilitation: Ready or Not?” is a review article that focused on results of clinical research and backs up the prior papers. It states that “daily BCI training can be very tiring and requires high levels of motivation” (Colucci, et al., 2022). This is complemented by the statement “lack of any movement may additionally weaken remaining synaptic connections.” (Colucci, et al., 2022) If training is very tiring and requires high motivation, it may have a detrimental effect on the mental health. This effect would worsen with lack of any movement. I understand how difficult it is to do something when you have little to no motivation. I see how it is a problem that failing to move has a negative impact on mental health. This evidence points me towards saying that BCIs have more negative effects than positive effects because there is a great amount of impact on mental health.

Conclusion
In conclusion, my findings and research show that there are both positives and negatives that occur from the use of BCI. However, the positives do not outweigh the negatives currently. I believe that BCIs will be more common in the future, and we need to prepare for it by placing in laws and boundaries that take ethical considerations into account. Based on my research, BCIs can help many people who suffer from severe disorders, but the risks, such as dramatic personality changes, are not worth the positive gain for many people.  BCI is becoming mainstream and medical risks should be of highest consideration when deciding whether the effect is overall positive for an individual. I think that it is a case-by-case decision whether BCIs will have an overall positive effect.
