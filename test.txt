 Ingredients

    1 cup Edmonds Self Raising Flour (150g)
    2 Tbsp Chelsea White Sugar
    Â½ tsp finely grated lemon zest (optional)
    1 cup Meadow Fresh Milk (or Soy/Rice milk) (250ml)
    1 egg, lightly beaten

Method

    Sift Edmonds Self Raising Flour and Chelsea White Sugar into a medium-large bowl. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients.

    Add the lemon zest, Meadow Fresh Milk, egg and melted Tararua Butter/margarine and whisk to combine.

    Heat a large non stick frying pan over medium heat and grease lightly with Tararua Butter or oil.

    For each pancake, place 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan. Cook for 2 minutes or until bubbles form on the surface. Turn and cook for a further 1 to 2 minutes, or until pancakes are cooked through.
     
    Garnish with berries, sliced banana and Chelsea Flavoured Syrup - Butterscotch, Caramel, Vanilla, Maple or Honey Maple.
